# CodeTempl
Because who wants to write <code>public static void main (String[] args)</code> every time they make a new file?

Makes a template source code file for my predefined languages so I don't have to set everything up. Takes away a few extra seconds of me typing out everything so I can crank out ideas quicker and get to the juice of the matter.

This little project is also a vehicle for my mision to teach myself Bash scripting and regular expressions

***Coming up***
Not that anyone is going to install this on their device, but if they <i>want</i> to I set up the repo with a zip file. It's at least a way for me to figure out installation :) Run the setup.sh script to put everything where it needs to go.
System requirements: I don't know. At the very least, Linux lol. I'm running Linux Mint Cinnamon 19.1. I know that it doesn't need to be anywhere near as specific. Just have a /bin and a /lib folder and the ability to run Bash scripts. I should probably find a more cogent answer for this.
